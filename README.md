# Abstract
Our solution is an autonomous car powered by a Raspberry Pi coded in Python, responsible for the main challenge logic, and an ESP microcontroller coded in C, responsible for controlling the motors and processing sensor data. The two devices communicate using UART. We use a 360° 2D LiDAR combined with a gyro to always know where the robot is on the mat. Detection of the traffic sign's color is done by combining the output of the LiDAR with the camera feed to know exactly where the object is. We use ackermann steering geometry calibrated so the car can leave the parking space in one continuous arc. Driving is powered by 1 DC motor through a differential gearbox designed from scratch, with a top speed of around 2.6 m/s.
